## 🧠 Agentic Blog Generator

A FastAPI-powered web application that uses multi-agent collaboration (via [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI)) to generate SEO-optimized blog posts on any topic using the Gemini LLM API. This project orchestrates a team of specialized agents to research, write, fact-check, optimize, and save the blog content.

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Multi-agent collaboration (researcher, writer, fact-checker, SEO expert, file writer)
* ✅ Uses Gemini API for intelligent blog content generation
* ✅ Web interface built with FastAPI and Jinja2 templates
* ✅ YAML-based configuration for agents and tasks
* ✅ Output is saved as a Markdown file (`Output.md`)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShashankraiOO7/ai-blog-generator.git
cd ai-blog-generator
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv crewai crewai-tools jinja2
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro
```

### 4. Set up Configuration Files

Ensure the `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml` files are placed in a `config/` directory. Example structure:

```
config/
├── agents.yaml
└── tasks.yaml
```

Each YAML should contain structured definitions for agents and their associated tasks.

## 🚀 Running the App

### Option 1: Web Interface

Start the FastAPI app:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser. Enter a topic to generate a blog post.

### Option 2: Command-Line

Run directly from Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will generate a blog post about "Agentic AI" (default) and save it as `Output.md`.

---

## 🐳 Docker Support

To run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t ai-blog-generator .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env ai-blog-generator
```

## 🧠 Agents & Tasks

Defined in `crew.py`, the following agents and tasks work in a sequential pipeline:

### Agents

* **Researcher**: Gathers relevant data
* **Writer**: Drafts the article
* **Fact Checker**: Validates content
* **SEO Expert**: Optimizes for search engines
* **File Writer**: Saves final output

### Tasks

Each agent is assigned a task, configured through `tasks.yaml` for customization.

## 📝 Output

After processing, the final blog post is saved to:

```
Output.md
```
